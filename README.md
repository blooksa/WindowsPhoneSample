# WindowsPhoneSample
This is a fully working boilerplate app for Windows Phone RT 8.1.
Use it when starting a new app, that is built using the MVVM pattern and is tightly integrated with Reactive Extensions.
You get the following base classes to help get up to speed in no time:

* ViewModel (with Bind/Unbind support for loading/unloading data)
* ServiceBase (for implementing services)
* WebServer (for the rest calls)
